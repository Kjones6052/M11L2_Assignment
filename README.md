# **Hello, World!**

The files in this repository are used for my assignment for React State and Props, Module 11 Lesson 2.


Overview:

In this assignment, I used React to creating 2 components that display information on a webpage. The first component is a class component that displays a user's profile 
name, and includes a button that changes the name when clicked. The second component is a function component that creates a list of movies with details about each movie like: title, director, year released, genre, and synopsis. Withing this second component is an unordered list displaying the movies by title, when the title is clicked then the details about the movie appear. There is also a button to switch from 'view all' to view by genre.
